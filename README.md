# UNO-Player
The Project zip file is the teacher's code given to recreate a match of UNO. I had the task of creating code that replicates a player that will abide by the rules
of UNO and implement strategy to win every match.

The "zeitz_UnoPlayer" class is empty and given to edit the name and add code.
